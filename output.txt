left. However, the best recourse is to accept the situation and build a path to recovery.

If your home loan hasn’t budged despite RBI rate cuts, your lender choice might be to blame.
by Yasmin Hussain
Have you ever wondered
why your home loan EMI
refuses to budge even
when the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) announces
a rate cut? If you’ve borrowed from a
Housing Finance Company (HFC),
you’re not alone in this frustration.
While your friend with a bank loan

fundamental difference in how banks
and HFCs operate—one that can cost
you thousands over your loan’s life-

you borrow from, a bank or an HFC,
becomes crucial. While both provide
