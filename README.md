### 📌 Project Summary

* The project extracts text from **PDF files** using `pdfplumber`.
* The text is saved into a `.txt` file.
* A **Tokenizer** from `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text` is applied to preprocess the text (convert to sequences, handle OOV tokens).
* This looks like an **NLP preprocessing pipeline** for text data extracted from documents.

Based on this, here’s a `README.md` draft for your GitHub project 👇

# PDF Text Extraction & Tokenization with TensorFlow

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how to extract text from PDF files and preprocess it for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Using **pdfplumber**, the text is extracted page by page and then converted into token sequences using TensorFlow’s **Tokenizer**. The pipeline can be extended for text analysis, model training, or other NLP applications.

## 🚀 Features

* Extracts text from PDF documents (`pdfplumber`).
* Saves extracted text into a `.txt` file.
* Tokenizes text with TensorFlow Keras Tokenizer.
* Prepares text sequences for downstream NLP tasks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* [TensorFlow / Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber)
* NumPy, Pickle, OS

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### requirements.txt

```
tensorflow
numpy
pdfplumber
```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Place your PDF files in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`gpt.ipynb`).
3. Extracted text will be saved into `output.txt`.
4. The text will be tokenized and prepared for NLP tasks.

## 📊 Example Output

* Extracted raw text from PDF
* Tokenized sequences (list of word indices)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add text cleaning & preprocessing (stopwords, stemming, lemmatization).
* Train an NLP model (RNN, LSTM, Transformer).
* Build a search or summarization pipeline from extracted PDFs.

Would you like me to also auto-generate a **`requirements.txt`** from the imports in your notebook so your repo is plug-and-play?
